### ‚ö° Prerequisites:

1. A Windows laptop and an Android phone
2. Both devices connected to the **same WiFi network**
3. Downloaded and extracted **Android SDK Platform Tools** (ADB tools) for Windows

* Now go to **Settings > Additional Settings > Developer Options**
* Enable **USB Debugging**

#### 2. **Prepare Platform Tools**

* Go to the folder where you extracted **platform-tools**
* Open a terminal in that folder (Shift + Right-click > Open in Terminal)

#### 3. **Connect the Phone**

* Use USB cable and select **File Transfer** mode on phone
* In terminal, run:

  ```bash
  ./adb devices
  ```
* Allow the connection when the phone prompts for authorization

#### 4. **Connect Over WiFi**

* Run the following to switch to TCP/IP mode:

  ```bash
  ./adb tcpip 5555
  ```
* Get your phone‚Äôs IP address (from WiFi settings)
