### 💻 What I Learned:

On Day 2, I explored how to install **Kali Linux**, a Debian-based distribution used by cybersecurity professionals. I learned that there are three main installation methods:
1. **Dual Boot** – Install Kali alongside Windows directly on hardware
2. **VMware** – Use a VMware Workstation/Player to run Kali as a virtual machine
3. **VirtualBox** – Open-source tool to run Kali as a VM (the method I used)

After successfully setting up Kali Linux in **VirtualBox**, I completed the **Linux Fundamentals module** on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), which introduced me to key terminal commands.
