# üîñ Day 3: Phishing Attack using CamPhish & Hack Camera  
**üìÖ Date:** June 19, 2025  

---

### üß† Topics Covered:
- Camera-based phishing attack using **Hack-Camera**
- Using `git clone` to copy tools from GitHub
- Giving script execution permission in Linux
- Launching phishing attacks through the terminal
- Real-world example: capturing webcam images using phishing
- Awareness about **social engineering risks**

---

### üíª What I Did:

Today I learned how phishing attacks can be executed using **webcam-based lures**. I cloned and executed a tool named **Hack-Camera**, which simulates a fake page asking for camera permission and secretly captures images when users accept.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed:

1. **Cloned the Hack-Camera tool**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaspreet-infosec/HACK-CAMERA.git
Navigated to the tool's folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd HACK-CAMERA
ls
Switched to root user:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo su
Gave execution permission to the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x hack_camera.sh
Ran the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
./hack_camera.sh
Selected Option 3 (YouTube Video Phishing)

Entered YouTube video ID as prompted

Received phishing link, opened it in browser

Browser asked for camera access
‚Üí When granted, it:

Played the YouTube video to distract the victim

Secretly captured webcam images

Sent images to attacker's terminal

Saved images in the HACK-CAMERA folder

‚ö†Ô∏è Real-World Implications:
This attack highlights how attackers exploit trust and curiosity:

Users often allow webcam access without thinking

Phishing pages can be disguised as something innocent like a video

Images are captured without user knowledge

üß† Key Learnings:
git clone helps you download open-source tools from GitHub

Linux chmod +x is used to allow execution of .sh files

Shell scripts can automate complex attacks

Social engineering is one of the most powerful tools in a hacker‚Äôs arsenal

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
Hack-Camera GitHub tool

Linux Terminal (Kali)

Browser for phishing simulation
