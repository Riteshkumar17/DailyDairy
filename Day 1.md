### 📚 What I Learned:

On the first day of training, I was introduced to the world of **cybersecurity and ethical hacking**. I learned that **ethical hacking** is the practice of testing systems and networks to identify security vulnerabilities, but in a **legal and authorized** manner.

We discussed the **differences between ethical hackers** (white hat) who protect systems, and **malicious hackers** (black hat) who attack systems for illegal purposes. Ethical hackers work with permission and help secure digital infrastructure.

I also learned about the **four phases of hacking**:
1. **Reconnaissance** – Collecting information about the target.
2. **Scanning** – Identifying open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
3. **Exploitation** – Using discovered flaws to gain access.
4. **Post-Exploitation** – Maintaining access or collecting data.

### ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Guidelines:
- Always have **written permission** before testing any system.
- Follow national and international **cyber laws** (like IT Act 2000 in India).
- Report vulnerabilities through **responsible disclosure**.
