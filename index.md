### 📚 What I Learned:

Today I learned the **foundation of cybersecurity** and its growing importance in protecting digital infrastructure. Ethical hacking plays a crucial role in detecting vulnerabilities **before malicious hackers exploit them**.

I understood that ethical hackers follow a structured approach, known as the **Hacking Methodology**, which includes:
1. **Reconnaissance** – Information gathering
2. **Scanning** – Target detection and vulnerability identification
3. **Exploitation** – Gaining unauthorized access
4. **Post-Exploitation** – Maintaining access, covering tracks, or extracting data

### 🔐 CIA Triad: Core Pillars of Cybersecurity

1. **Confidentiality** – Ensuring that sensitive data is accessed only by authorized people.  
2. **Integrity** – Making sure the data is accurate and not altered without permission.  
3. **Availability** – Ensuring that systems and data are accessible when needed.  

The **CIA Triad** is the **foundation of cybersecurity** – all strategies and defenses revolve around maintaining these three principles.

### 💼 Job Preferences in Cybersecurity

I also explored different job roles in the field. Based on what I enjoy (problem-solving, practical tasks, and protection mindset), here are some **roles that interest me**:

- 🔍 **Penetration Tester (Ethical Hacker)** – Simulate attacks to find vulnerabilities  
- 🛡️ **SOC Analyst (Security Operations Center)** – Monitor and respond to threats in real-time  
- 💻 **Cybersecurity Analyst** – Analyze and strengthen security measures  
- 🔐 **Network Security Engineer** – Secure network infrastructure  
- 🧠 **Security Researcher** – Study new attack trends and develop countermeasures  

These roles require skills in **networking, Linux, scripting, and security tools** — all of which I will be learning in the coming weeks.

### ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Guidelines:
- Always work with **written permission**
- Follow applicable **cyber laws** (e.g., IT Act 2000 in India)
- Report vulnerabilities **responsibly and ethically**
